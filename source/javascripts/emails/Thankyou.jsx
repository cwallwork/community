                It was great to see you last night. I really enjoyed our meaningful conversations about [BOOK TITLE] especially [INSERT REFERENCE TO SPECIFIC CONVERSATION]. Today, I feel more connected to the global refugee crisis and want to continue learning about the situation. I hope you do too.
